# Important

Because I am a bloody beginner in nix, I couldn't install for example NvChad, so you have to do that manually. 
This is just a list of all of these packages and how to install them

# NvChad

`git clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/.config/nvim && nvim`
Then in Nvim after all the plugins installed, run: `:MasonInstallAll`
Then run `:Lazy sync`
Then to switch themes Press `space`+`th` and select catppuccin
